Device 0 (VID=0502 and PID=337d) is UNKNOWN.

============= NEW FOR LATER =============

1. Export to X3D
2. GTK window/widgets
3. Labels at TriCont()
4. Drawing of saddle quadrangles
5. 2D textures as one of standard way for coloring -- if '%' present in color scheme
6. Graph(mreal x, mreal y, names, styles, font, size); -- names = "node1[node2,node3,node4[node5,node6]]", styles -- the same + apply for subnodes if absent. Styles are colors (fill,border,line), dash (to subnodes), marks "dos^v><", arrows.
7. Use libtcc for mglFormula only! -- note that MGL formulas (i.e. for mglData) are fast enough. The only possible speeding up for Fill() and Modify() functions
8. 3D text (with depth, for Quality=3)
9. Text along 3D curve (for Quality=3)

============= NEW FOR v.2.1 =============

0. check for possible memory leaks before release

1. Axis -- projection (ternary + quaternary) + sample
3. curved text (in new sample) look not so good
+4. WX window/widgets

============= DOCS =============

1. Update web_*.texi -- links

2. Text about UDAV (tabs,dialogs,hotkeys,hints,mouse)
* known feature -- if you draw something in function then highlighted all similar objects

3. Add FAQ about MPEG/GIF and PDF, JavaScript
4. JSON samples in documentation ?!!
5. Hint about inverse axis range
6. Axis style 'XYZ' for opposite tick and axis labels
7. Quality=3 will draw 3D arrows instead of default 2D 
8. Update text about drop sample

============= UDAV =============

01. Show plot at creation stage (if option is enabled -- can be long process!!!) + auto axis range or [-1,1] by default

02. Double click -> setup dialog (optionally -- after QTreeWidgetItem)

03. Dialog for InPlot(s):
{SubPlot,MultiPlot}	-- enable rotate,aspect,title
{ColumnPlot}		-- enable rotate,several
{StickPlot}		-- enable several
{InPlot}		-- enable rotate,aspect,title
Image with gray alternatives and black choice

04. QTreeWidgetItem -- ICON (func/call,if,for,once,subplot,...); annotation/name; (keep LINE - POS in script). After editing/changing --> put text to editor.
Buttons: new,load,save // newcmd,hide,annotation,collapse on/off,setup // calc. Click on item cause change of line number in editor.
05. Group/ungroup if command in single line, separated by ':'
06. Hide plot/group by putting "#h " at beginning of line
07. Annotation of plot/group -- comment before it
08. Drag&drop plot/group between inplots (in tree widget)

09. Create default plot dependently of selected row/column/range in data table
10. Data change via menu/toolbar -- save to internal script => enable undo + save initial array(?)

+11. Add primitives by mouse at beginning of script + change its size/position by mouse + "attraction" points
The primitives are: ball, line, ellipse/circle, rect, rhomb, text, curve.
Use frames for quickly drawing of main plot
Dbl.click on primitive --> dialog for styles
Dbl.click on active point -->remove primitive
Save/load into script between blocks "#----- MathGL block -----" +  hide it in editor

12. Multi-threading for enabling "stop".

13. Manual rotate (i.e. change rotate arguments) by spinboxes ???

14. Close button on data tabs ?!?

============= UNSURE ===========

1. Problem with \calB and so on (\calH, ...) -- they are present only in italic font :(.
2. create PWT fonts
3. \dfrac for normal size and centering  (sample \big\big{\frac{1}{2}}) ???
4. "Cut off" curves if text is printed inside it (for contour labels) ?!?
5. String variables in MGL + readstr command.
6. Pool of threads for speeding up ??? or openmp ???
7. Read DICOM files
8. Check RunThr() in python/octave
9. Try libtcc (TinyCC) as alternative to MGL -- how to handle ^ operator???
10. Auto axis range for formulas, like AutoRange("y(x)") or AutoRange('x',"x(t)").
11. Use Hershey as built-in font ??? -- for smaller size only
