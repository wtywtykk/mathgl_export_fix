Device 0 (VID=0502 and PID=337d) is UNKNOWN.

============= NEW  =============

2. Add help about cmake into the "Installation and using" -- after build system will be ready
3. Add FAQ about MPEG/GIF and PDF

4. Check RunThr() in python

============= FOR V.2.1 ========

1. MPI_Send(), MPI_Recv()
2. Use Hershey as built-in font ?!!
3. Import/Export via GIF (as 3d data) ???
4. Read DICOM files ???
5. Export to JavaScript (WebGL)
6. GTK and WX window/widgets
7. Labels at TriCont()

8. Option 'absolute' for coordinates in absolute range (i.e. [0,1]) ???
9. Save primitives for frames (not bitmap) ??? -- see MGL_USEDRWDAT
10. Enable several fonts at the same picture
11. Table(float x, float y, HCDT dat, char *xlabels, char *ylabels, char *stl) -- draw table with values (+ auto reduce font size?)
12. Parallelization of drawing (MathGL level) -- bug with primitives drawing --> pixel.cpp
13. Triangulation + GridData (for interpolation to regular grid)
14. Axis -- projection (ternary + quaternary)
15. Examples of animation, u3d, x3d, js and so on

16. Check fontsize maximum ?!?
17. curved text (in new sample) look not so good
18. emulate fog in EPS/SVG
19. line segment losses in EPS ???

20. Add mglDataC for complex data -- main diff is reading/saving data
21. MGL testing system ???
22. Export to X3D
23. Try libtcc (TinyCC) as alternative to MGL -- in mgllab???
24. Use OI & Z for determining {x,y,z} from {xs,ys}. Try to find closest.
25. More accurate intersections in Region
26. Add flag for drawing 3d arrows instead of 2d (S,D -- cube, T -- sq.pyramid, I -- square, O -- sphere???, A,K,V -- ???)
27. s_hull for triangulation -- add define for any cerr (or exclude streams
at all) + testing
28. Add extra texture in Error -- for handling transparency of "marks"
29. Textual colors, like "{0xFF00FF}" ?!?

============= UDAV =============

01. Dialog for data input
-----------------------------------------------
| [Data name |V|]				      |
| [x1]     [x2]		[func]		{ADD} |
| [y1]     [y2]		[suf|V]		{ADD} |
| [z1]     [z2]	[oper|V] [dir]	{ADD} |
| Reuslt [				]		      |
| 			{Cancel}	{OK}		  |
-----------------------------------------------
Ranges can be inverted.
Remove other setting if data name is changed.

02. Double click -> jump to string + setup dialog (optionally)
03. Dialog for InPlot(s):
{SubPlot,MultiPlot}	-- enable rotate,aspect,title
{ColumnPlot}		-- enable rotate,several
{StickPlot}		-- enable several
{InPlot}		-- enable rotate,aspect,title

04. Group/ungroup if command in single line, separated by ':'
05. Hide plot/group by putting "#h " at beginning of line
06. Annotation of plot/group -- comment before it
09. Data change via menu/toolbar -- save to internal script => enable undo + save initial array(?)
10. Add primitives by mouse at beginning of script + change its size/position by mouse + "attraction" points
11. Drag&drop plot/group between inplots
12. Create default plot dependently of selected row/column/range in data table
13. Show plot at creation stage (if option is enabled -- can be size_t process!!!)
14. Rotate/perspective/lighting/... of primitive list (without script re-execution)

15. QTreeWidgetItem -- ICON (if,for,once,subplot,...); Cmd text; LINE - POS in group/line. After editing/changing --> put text to editor.

17. Setupable hot-keys ?!?
18. Insert just filename (without path) by demand

============= UNSURE ===========

1. Problem with \calB and so on (\calH, ...) -- they are present only in italic font :(.
2. create PWT fonts
3. \dfrac for normal size and centering  (sample \big\big{\frac{1}{2}}) ???
4. "Cut off" curves if text is printed inside it (for contour labels) ?!?
5. String variables in MGL + readstr command.
6. Pool of threads for speeding up ???
7. Drops as mglPrim -- not accurate but smaller memory and faster
8. Text aspect ratio in OpenGL mode
