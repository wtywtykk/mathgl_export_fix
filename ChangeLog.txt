2.0.4 Released ?? October 2012

* Color can be specified as its RGB[A] values. i.e. like "{xFFFFFF}" or "{xFFFFFFFF}".
* Color in color scheme  may have position in range [0,1]. Format is {CN,pos} or {xNNNNNN,pos}.
* Vectors is drawn now even if only starting or ending points are placed in bounding box.
* Strongly rewrite the algorithm of vector field plotting.
* Add Vect3() plot for drawing vectors on slice of 3d vector field.
* CalcXYZ() function now use data from z-buffer for better determining {x,y,z} coordinates.
* Make code compilable by Borland compiler too.
* Improve output in OpenGL mode.
* Add fog at export in EPS/SVG formats.
* Add ZoomAxis() for zooming/shifting axis range as whole.
* Export functions now can write in stdout if file name is "-".

* Add WriteJSON() function for exporting in JSON format suitable for later drawing by JavaScript
* Add mglcgi for parsing MGL script as CGI request which return PNG or SVG image.
* Add mglData::Solve() for finding x-value where dat(x)=val.
* Add mglData::Clean() for removing rows with duplicate values for given column.
* Functions mglData::Spline*, mglData::Linear* now can return gradient at the point.
* Add class mglDataC for complex data arrays.


* Add dialog for data arguments in UDAV.
* Mouse position at an object click now is displayed on the image itself.

* Update samples
* Update documentation
* Different bugfixes
