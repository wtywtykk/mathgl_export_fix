2.1 Released ?? October 2012

* Color can be specified as its RGB[A] values, i.e. like "{xFFFFFF}" or "{xFFFFFFFF}".
* Color in color scheme  may have position in range [0,1]. Format is {CN,pos} or {xFFFFFF,pos}.
* Vectors is drawn now even if only starting or ending points are placed in bounding box.
* Strongly rewrite the algorithm of vector field plotting.
* Add Vect3() plot for drawing vectors on slice of 3d vector field.
* CalcXYZ() function now use data from z-buffer for better determining {x,y,z} coordinates.
* Make code compilable by Borland compiler too.
* Improve output in OpenGL mode.
* Add fog at export in EPS/SVG formats.

* Add ZoomAxis() for zooming/shifting axis range as whole.
* Export functions now can write in stdout if file name is "-".

* Add WriteJSON() function for exporting in JSON format suitable for later drawing by JavaScript
* Add mglcgi for parsing MGL script as CGI request which return PNG or SVG image.
* Add mglData::Solve() for finding x-value where dat(x)=val.
* Add mglData::Clean() for removing rows with duplicate values for given column.
* Functions mglData::Spline*, mglData::Linear* now can return gradient at the point.
* Add class mglDataC for complex data arrays.
* Now you can use different font-faces in the plot simultaneously.
* Frames now save 3D information if MGL_VECT_FRAME is set (by default).
* Picture drawing now use multi-threading for each stage.
* Add Table() function for drawing table with data values.
* Now Legend() automatically use several columns if it contain too many legend entries.
* Add mglParse::AllowFileIO() for enable/disable I/O commands in MGL scripts.

* Add dialog for data arguments in "New command" dialog of UDAV.
* Value of arguments are saved while the kind of command is changed in "New command" dialog of UDAV.
* Extend classification of commands in "New command" dialog of UDAV and make it automatic.
* Mouse position at an object click now is displayed on the image itself.
* Add zoom in/out by mouse wheel.
* Add zoom in/out of axis range by mouse wheel, and shift of axis range by middle button.
* Text editor in UDAV now highlight current line.
* Completer can be switched off correctly now.
* Multi-line strings (i.e. separated by "\" symbol) are highlighted correctly now.

* Grid lines for NAN origin values are always located at far-away edges.
* Try correctly place axis and tick labels even for axis with inverse range (i.e. for v2<v1). 
  Note, it work well for 2D axis. One should use Aspect() with negative values to do it correctly in general case.
* Axis style 'XYZ' draw corresponding axis with ticks labels from other side of axis. This also influence on followng Label() calls.

* Add MGL commands 'errbox', 'face'
* Add mgl.cgi tool which return PNG image for CGI request in form of MGL script.

* Update list of built-in glyphs
* Update samples
* Update documentation
* Different bugfixes

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES in the arguments of functions: mgl_axis, mgl_axis_grid, mgl_label, mgl_labelw, mgl_legend_pos, mgl_legend; and in functions for MGL parsing.
* mglFourier now make true inverse transform

2.0.3 Released 27 July 2012

* Make code compilable by compilers GNU/MinGW GCC, Clang, MS VisualStudio
* Add mglTriangulation() using s_hull_pro algorithm
* Add mglData::Grid() and mglGraph::DataGrid() for filling regular data by values of triangulated surface
* Add cmake options 'enable-png' and 'enable-zlib'
* Add SetTimeUTC() for using UTC time instead of local one
* Add SetTickShift() for additional shift of tick labels
* Add mglGraph::MPI_Send() and mglGraph::MPI_Recv()
* Vector plots now draw vector at edges, which are directed out of bounding box
* Add gap between 1d plots for avoiding possible undetermined overlapping.
* Add parallel build for documentation
* Bugfixes for memory leaks and uninitialized variables
* Bugfix for setting text size
* Bugfix for handling NAN color value
* Bugfix for missing lines in export to EPS/SVG

2.0.2 Released 24 May 2012

* Add 'U' style for Axis() which disable ticks rotation.
* Bugfix for enable-opengl option.
* Bugfix for lighting.

2.0.1 Released 23 May 2012

* Improve speed of drawing
* Add reading 3d data files using mglData::ReadMat()
* Exclude unnecessary dependencies/inclusions
* Improve build system
	- Add multithreading
	- Add install for Octave
	- Separate enable-doc option from enable-all
* Minor bugfixes
